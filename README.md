# firstMEANCRUDApp

I believe the project video for this is rather dated. It uses deprecated http modules. I used the current ways of doint things with HttpClientModules but it broke. I was unable to get the delete function to work properly (although the url it sends to delete is accurate) and get a 404, probably something to do with deprecation. Old video.

Still, it opened my eyes to what working with the MEAN stack will look in the future. Also, the guy coding the video I was following was very sloppy so I wouldn't be surprised if the program is flawed from the get go.

I got the add item function to actually work, and the edit item form toggle works, and the adding item button won't submit unless it is valid.
